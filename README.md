This is a complete reimplantation of “AmosPro craft extension”, original was written in assembler, 
this is a reimplemented using documentations, and by trial and error, the aim is to allow Amos basic programs written for craft extension to work in Amos Kittens. The original extension does not work Amos Kittens.
